function [P2,D2] = sortem(P, D)
% this function takes in two matrices P and D, presumably the output 
% from Matlab's eig function, and then sorts the columns of P to 
% match the sorted columns of D (going from largest to smallest)

% Make diagonal matrix out of sorted diagonal values of input D
D2 = diag(sort(diag(D), 'descend')); 

% Store the indices of which columns the sorted eigenvalues come from
[c, ind] = sort(diag(D), 'descend'); 

% Arrange the columns in this order
P2 = P(:,ind);
